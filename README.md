TWO DISTANCES INTERSECTION PLUGIN FOR QGIS APPLICATION


The plugin allows you get the intersection of two distances (2D Cartesian). Launched in the following QGIS versions: 3.34.7, 3.34.11, 3.34.13, 3.40.2.

Note 1: There is no way to place a circle on a map in QGIS. A circle is represented as a polygon called a circular string. The plugin offers better accuracy than drawing two intersecting circular strings.

Note 2: Since QGIS 3.40, there is a 2-Circle Point Intersection tool in the Advanced Digitization Panel.

Version 1.0.18
